This extension for RT adds a new "Forgot your password?" link to the front
of your RT instance. Any user can request that RT send them a password
reset token by email.  RT will send the user a one-time URL which he or
she can use to reset her password. This extension allows _all_ users to
reset their passwords by email. There isn't yet an option to only allow
staff users or non-staff users to reset their passwords.

This extension should be compatible with RT 3.4 and RT 3.6.

To install this extension:

perl Makefile.PL
make install
